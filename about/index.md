Hi there! I'm Ajat Prabha, a Computer Science and Engineering undergrad at Indian Institute of Technology, Jodhpur. I love doing development coding and you can go check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/ajatprabha) account for my projects.

> I've just completed my sophomore year and currently I'm working as a software engineer intern with [GO-JEK Tech](http://www.gojek.io/), Indonesia's first unicorn.

I'm a dancer too. Not that great but yeah, I know how to move my legs and arms! ðŸ˜œ

I also write blog posts at my institute's development group's [blog](https://students.iitj.ac.in/blog). And yes, I initiated the group. ðŸ˜‰
