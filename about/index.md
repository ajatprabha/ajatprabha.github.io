Hi there! I'm Ajat Prabha, a Computer Science and Engineering undergrad at Indian Institute of Technology, Jodhpur. I love doing development coding and you can go check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/ajatprabha) account for my projects.

> I'm currently a final year student and a [GSoC student]() with Cloud Native Computing Foundation working on Kubernetes. I also worked as a software engineering intern with [GO-JEK Tech](http://www.gojek.io/), Indonesia's first unicorn in summer 2018.

I'm a dancer too. Not that great but yeah, I know how to move my legs and arms! ðŸ˜œ  
Also a founding member of the student development community at IIT Jodhpur called [Devlup Labs](https://github.com/devlup-labs). ðŸ˜‰
