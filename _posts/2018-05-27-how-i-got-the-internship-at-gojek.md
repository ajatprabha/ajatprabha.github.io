It was October I guess and campus interviews for internships were going on and I could easily spot my seniors wearing formals inside the campus. And believe me I couldn't even recognize one of the seniors whom I already knew ðŸ˜›. One morning I asked my batch-mate that I wanna see the interview process! He was a volunteer in Student Placement Cell. He said, no problem, come with me tonight.  

I went and it was GoJek taking the coding round. I saw a familiar face, Aayush Sharda he was, one of my seniors from `Defeat The Beat`, our dance club. Abhinav Rai, another of my seniors was also there. Abhinav asked me to take the question paper and do it in 1 hour ðŸ˜‚. It was meant to be done in 3 hours though. I read the problem statement, it didn't seem that difficult to me, I skipped it anyway ðŸ˜….  

After the coding round was over I asked Aayush that what do they look for while examining the candidates. He replied, we look at various aspects like how do they name variables, how do they react to input while pair programming, what is their coding style, are they focusing on getting shit done or spending their time in optimizing it, etc. to name a few. It was surprising but only 1 person was able to finish all the milestones of the problem statement. Why? Because most of the people were stuck at optimizing the first milestone! ðŸ˜…  

After listening to all this, I decided to show the repository of one of my projects I did that summer to Aayush. He asked me to send the link. Later that night, I received a call from Aayush and he asked me to come over to the guest house where he was staying. He asked me questions which were a little out of context to me at first but he was just making sure that I actually wrote the code. ðŸ˜…  

For the next half an hour he was just telling me about what GoJek is and what does it do. And then came the question, "Tu GoJek k saath intern karega?" like if I would say no! Hell yeah, who would deny an internship in a unicorn. ðŸ˜…
